a     Use the pd.read_csv() function to read the data into Python. Call
        the loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory
        set to the correct location for the data.
(b)     Look at the data used in the notebook by creating and running
        a new cell with just the code college in it. You should notice
        that the frst column is just the name of each university in a
        column named something like Unnamed: 0. We donâ€™t really want
        pandas to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have
        these names for later. Try the following commands and similarly
        look at the resulting data frames:

(c)     Use the describe() method of to produce a numerical summary
        of the variables in the data set.
        
(d)     Use the pd.plotting.scatter_matrix() function to produce a
        scatterplot matrix of the frst columns [Top10perc, Apps, Enroll].
        Recall that you can reference a list C of columns of a data frame
        A using A[C].

(e)     Use the boxplot() method of college to produce side-by-side
        boxplots of Outstate versus Private.
